# Assignment 2 – Introduction to Data Science

This repository contains solutions for Assignment 2.  
Each question is implemented in a separate Python file.

## File Overview

Problem 1  
Reads a text file, performs text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, token filtering), counts word frequencies, and prints the 10 most frequent words.

Problem 2  
Processes the same text file to generate and count bigrams (pairs of consecutive words), then prints the 5 most frequent bigrams.

Problem 3  
Identifies near-duplicate lines in a text file after normalizing case, whitespace, and punctuation.

Problem 4  
Filters student data based on study time, internet access, and absences. Saves the filtered dataset and reports summary statistics.

Problem 5  
Creates grade categories and generates grouped summary statistics including counts, average absences, and internet access percentages.

Problem 6  
Creates a crime risk category based on violent crime rates and compares average unemployment rates between groups.

Problem 7  
Scrapes the Wikipedia Data Science page to extract the page title and first substantial paragraph.

Problem 8  
Extracts section headings from the Wikipedia Data Science page and saves them to a text file.

Problem 9  
Scrapes the Wikipedia Machine Learning page to extract the first table with sufficient data rows and saves it as a CSV file.

Problem 10  
Implements a reusable function that searches for a keyword within a text file and returns matching line numbers and content.

All scripts are designed to run independently.
